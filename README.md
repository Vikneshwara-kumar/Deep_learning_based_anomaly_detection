# Deep Learning based anomaly detection 

### Project Description:
A Cascade CNN-LSTM model is developed for anomaly detection and mitigation. This model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, enabling efficient handling of system anomalies.

The Exoskeleton Assistance was aimed to develop an untethered exoskeleton that provides real-world assistance. The Exoskeleton is prone to failures, different types of failures. These may include sensor malfunctions, actuator failures, or communication errors. By detecting the faults before they occure will prevent and mitigate critical damage to the human wearning the Exoskeleton.  The Goal of this project is to build a anomly detection system based on the seneor data from the exoskeleton.
